## What is StructyHub?

Welcome to StructyHub, a Chrome extension designed to seamlessly integrate your coding practice with GitHub. Inspired by <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub/aciombdipochlnkbpcbgdpjffcfdbggi">LeetHub</a>, StructyHub automates the process of pushing your successful code solutions to a dedicated GitHub repository whenever you pass all tests on a Structy problem. This tool aims to streamline your workflow and showcase your coding journey, making it an ideal companion for both learning and professional development.

## How can I use it?

Using StructyHub is extremely straightforward. Get started with the following steps:

- Install <a href="https://github.com/cbkinase/StructyHub">StructyHub</a> from the Chrome Web Store.
- Click on the StructyHub extension.
- Click "Sign in with GitHub" to allow StructyHub to interact with the GitHub API.
- And that's it! Your successful submissions will now populate a public repository called "Structy-Hub".
