## What is StructyHub?

Welcome to StructyHub, a Chrome extension designed to easily integrate your coding practice with GitHub. Inspired by <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub/aciombdipochlnkbpcbgdpjffcfdbggi">LeetHub</a>, StructyHub automates the process of pushing your successful code solutions to a dedicated GitHub repository whenever you pass all tests on a Structy problem.

## How can I use it?

Using StructyHub is extremely straightforward. Get started with the following steps:

- <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/structyhub/ignimibnnkigbbgdkjcmeijacogeiabe">Install StructyHub</a> from the Chrome Web Store.
- Click on the StructyHub extension.
- Click "Sign in with GitHub" to allow StructyHub to interact with the GitHub API.
- And that's it! Your successful submissions will now populate a public repository called "Structy-Hub".


## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy outlines StructyHub's commitment to protecting user privacy and the handling of data.

### Use of OAuth2 for Authorization
StructyHub uses OAuth2 to authorize its interaction with your GitHub account. This approach ensures that StructyHub can access certain GitHub API functionalities without the need to access or store your GitHub credentials. The tokens provided by OAuth2 are used strictly within the scope of permissions granted by you, the user. This keeps the authorization process secure and focused, aligning with the extension's purpose of syncing your code to GitHub.

### Specific Network Request Monitoring
StructyHub monitors network requests, but only those made to specific domains: www.github.com and www.structy.net. This process is essential for the functional operation of our service and is limited to the context of your interaction with these websites. We do not store or use this data beyond the immediate functional requirements.

### No Collection of Personal Data
We prioritize your privacy and security. StructyHub does not collect, store, or process any personal information from our users. Our service operates without requiring the storage of your personal data.

### No Tracking, Analytics, or Third-Party Data Sharing
Your privacy is of utmost importance:
- No Tracking or Analytics: We do not deploy tracking or analytics tools, ensuring a private user experience.
- No Data Sharing: Since no personal data is collected, there is no sharing or disclosure of such information with third parties.

### Data Security
Despite not collecting personal data, we prioritize the overall security of our service. Regular updates and security checks ensure StructyHub remains secure and resilient.

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy as necessary. Any changes will be updated on this page. Regular review of our policy is encouraged.
