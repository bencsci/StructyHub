# StructyHub

### TODO:

- OAuth2 (with proper GitHub permissions)
- Create repo if not exists
- Create commit on successful submission
- Get and display more submission stats (ms runtime for each test case I guess? not as much detail as on LC)
- Preferences options
    - public vs private repo (default public)
    - change name of repo (default structy_submissions)
- More info about overall stats?
