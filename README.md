# StructyHub

### TODO:
- Get and display more submission stats (ms runtime for each test case I guess? not as much detail as on LC)
- Preferences options
    - public vs private repo (default public)
    - change name of repo (default structy_submissions)
- More info about overall stats?
- Don't make commit when does not differ from preceding submission
